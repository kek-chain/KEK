# Contract Deployment

## Truffle
### Using Truffle
### Setting up the development environment
There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following: Requirements:
1. Windows, Linux or Mac OS X
1. [Node.js v8.9.4 LTS or Later](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Recommendations for Windows
If you're running Truffle on Windows, you may encounter some naming conflicts that could prevent Truffle from executing properly. Please see the section on resolving naming conflicts for solutions.

## Installing
Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Truffle:
>`npm install -g truffle`

To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type truffle version on a terminal. If you see an error, make sure that your npm modules are added to your path.

## Create A Project
The first step is to create a Truffle project. We'll use the *DogeLoop as an example, which creates a token that can be transferred between accounts:
* Create a new directory for your Truffle project  
* Intialize your project:

    >`truffle init`
