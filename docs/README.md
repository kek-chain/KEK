## What is KeKChain

A cryptocurrency system that supports smart contracts without the scalability and privacy limitations of earlier systems like Ethereum. KEK Chain, like Ethereum, allows parties to create smart contracts using code to specify the behavior of the virtual machine (VM) that executes the contract's function.KeK Chain strives to solve scalability and usability issues, without compromising decentralization, and leverages the existing developer community and ecosystem. It is an off-chain/external scaling solution for existing platforms to provide scalability and superior user experience for DApps/user features
___


> KeK Chain brings EVM-compatible programmability and native cross-chain communication using an innovative consensus of Proof of Stake and Authority(PoSA)
___

## How Does KeK chain Work? What is the Architecture and consensus used?

KeK Chain relies on a system with Proof of Stake and Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees.
___
## What is Proof of Stake Authority
PoSA is a combination of PoA and PoS. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators, they are elected in and out based on a staking based governance. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner

___

## What are the benefits for developers to build on KeK chain?
* EVM-compatible: KeK Chain supports all the existing Ethereum tooling Fast block time, cheaper cost

* Native cross-chain trasfer & communication: ApuSwap in development

___
## What Makes KeK chain different?

* Proof-of-Stake and Authority Consensus
* Native Cross-Chain Communication using Bridge

* Expand the use cases of KeK token by patnering with big projects on other chains
___
## KeK Chain is EVM-compatible. what does that mean?
EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. Any smart-contract written to run in EVM can be easily ported to KeK Chain.
